Contribution Process:
-Forks and branches: Each team member has a personal fork of the main repository. Work is done by members on a specific branch separate from the main branch of their fork so that members can keep the main branch of their personal fork up to date with the main repository.
-Pushing changes: When a member has made satisfactory changes and wants to push the changes all the way to the main repository they push from their working branch to the main branch of their fork, then up to the main repository through a pull request. This pull request is reviewed by another team member before being accepted. Upon acceptance, team members should update the scrum board to reflect what work has been done.
